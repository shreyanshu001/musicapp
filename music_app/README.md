🔧 Step-by-Step Setup
1. Create Flutter Project
bashflutter create music_services_app
cd music_services_app
2. Replace pubspec.yaml
Copy the provided pubspec.yaml content and run:
bashflutter pub get
3. Firebase Setup
A. Create Firebase Project

Go to Firebase Console
Click "Add project"
Enter project name: music-services-app
Follow setup wizard

B. Add Flutter App to Firebase

In Firebase console, click "Add app" → Flutter
Enter package name: com.example.music_services_app
Download google-services.json (Android) and/or GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS)

C. Configure Platform Files
Android Configuration:

Place google-services.json in android/app/
Edit android/build.gradle:

gradledependencies {
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
}

Edit android/app/build.gradle:

gradleapply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'
}
iOS Configuration:

Place GoogleService-Info.plist in ios/Runner/
Open ios/Runner.xcworkspace in Xcode
Add the plist file to the Runner target

4. Create Project Structure
Create the following folder structure in lib/:
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── constants/
│   └── di/
├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   └── repositories/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   └── repositories/
└── presentation/
    ├── providers/
    ├── screens/
    └── widgets/
5. Add All Dart Files
Copy all the provided Dart files into their respective folders:

main.dart (root lib folder)
core/constants/app_constants.dart
core/di/injection_container.dart
domain/entities/music_service.dart
domain/repositories/music_service_repository.dart
data/models/music_service_model.dart
data/repositories/music_service_repository_impl.dart
presentation/providers/music_services_provider.dart
presentation/widgets/service_card.dart
presentation/screens/home_screen.dart
presentation/screens/service_detail_screen.dart

6. Firebase Firestore Setup
A. Enable Firestore

In Firebase console, go to "Firestore Database"
Click "Create database"
Choose "Start in test mode" for now
Select a location

B. Add Sample Data
Create a collection called music_services with these documents:
Document 1:
json{
  "title": "Music Production",
  "description": "Professional music production services for artists and creators",
  "iconName": "music_note",
  "isActive": true
}
Document 2:
json{
  "title": "Sound Engineering",
  "description": "Expert sound engineering and mixing services",
  "iconName": "equalizer",
  "isActive": true
}
Document 3:
json{
  "title": "Music Lessons",
  "description": "Learn instruments and music theory from professionals",
  "iconName": "school",
  "isActive": true
}
Document 4:
json{
  "title": "Live Recording",
  "description": "High-quality live recording sessions in our studio",
  "iconName": "mic",
  "isActive": true
}
Document 5:
json{
  "title": "Audio Mastering",
  "description": "Professional audio mastering for final production",
  "iconName": "tune",
  "isActive": true
}
Document 6:
json{
  "title": "Podcast Production",
  "description": "Complete podcast production and editing services",
  "iconName": "podcast",
  "isActive": true
}
C. Firestore Security Rules (for testing)
javascriptrules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /music_services/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
7. Run the App
bashflutter pub get
flutter run
📱 Testing the App

Launch: App should start and show loading indicator
Data Loading: Services should load from Firestore and display in grid
Tap Navigation: Tapping any service card should navigate to detail screen
Back Navigation: Back button should return to home screen
Error Handling: Turn off internet to test error states
Retry: Retry button should reload data

🎬 Screen Recording Checklist
When recording your demo:

✅ Start from app launch
✅ Show loading state
✅ Display loaded services grid
✅ Tap multiple service cards
✅ Show navigation to detail screens
✅ Demonstrate back navigation
✅ Show refresh functionality (pull down or retry button)

🏗️ Architecture Overview
MVVM Pattern

Model: MusicServiceModel - Data representation
View: HomeScreen, ServiceDetailScreen - UI screens
ViewModel: MusicServicesProvider - Business logic and state

State Management

Provider: Manages app state and notifies UI of changes
States: Loading, Loaded, Error, Initial

Dependency Injection

get_it: Service locator for dependency injection
Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access
